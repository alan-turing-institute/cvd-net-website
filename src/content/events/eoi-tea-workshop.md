## About

As part of the EPSRC Networks of Cardiovascular Digital Twins (CVDNet) project, and in partnership with the [UKRI DTNet+](https://www.dtnetplus.ac.uk/) Uncertainty and Trust Special Interest Group, we are seeking expressions of interest for skills and training workshops.

These workshops will bring together researchers, developers, and other practitioners to help establish a community of practice focused on the trustworthy and ethical assurance of healthcare digital twins.

We aim to hold these workshops in **Early 2026**. To ensure these workshops provide value to the participants, we are seeking initial expressions of interest to better understand the goals that matter to potential participants. The answers provided in the following short form will help us design the workshop to meet the needs and priorities of the community.
