As cardiac models have become more widespread, there has been increasing interest in building personalised models that can be used for both hypothesis testing and forecasting. Taking account of uncertainties in both data and models is a key aspect of linking computational models to real hearts and safety-critical decision making.

## About the Workshop

The Fickle Heart workshop series is partly funded by the CVD-Net project and aims to share best practice and raise the profile of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in cardiac and cardiovascular modelling and simulation. This two-day event brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss the latest developments in the field.

## Key Topics

- Uncertainty quantification in cardiac modelling
- Personalised cardiac models
- Data and model uncertainties
- Safety-critical decision making in cardiovascular applications
- Best practices in cardiac simulation
