			"Run a dedicated prospective clinical study to collect new, detailed data from PAH patients over time, using standard care methods, intensive hospital/remote monitoring (e.g. wearables, MRI), and even embedded monitors.",

			"Create the core technical framework and infrastructure, such as a secure research environment (SRE).",
			"Develop the 'digital thread' for each patient (containing all their data, simulations, forecasts) and weave these threads together into a 'digital tapestry'.",

			"Build on calibrated twins (from WP3) to provide sufficient and reliable predictive power.",
			"Develop and evaluate novel forecasting techniques (e.g., NARX models, Transformer-based approaches, mixed-effects models) to predict clinical worsening events and changes in clinical measurements over 6-12 months.",
