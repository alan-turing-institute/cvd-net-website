			<p>
				ModularCirc is a software toolkit designed to help
				scientists and engineers create computer simulations of the
				heart and circulatory system. Think of it as a set of
				digital building blocks that represent different parts of
				our cardiovascular system, like heart chambers (e.g., atria
				and ventricles), valves (which control blood flow
				direction), and various blood vessels (like arteries and
				veins).
			</p>

			<p>
				The "modular" part of its name is key. Instead of building a
				highly detailed 3D anatomical replica, ModularCirc uses a
				simplified but effective approach. It treats each component
				as a distinct module with specific functions and properties
				(e.g., how elastic a heart chamber is, or how much
				resistance a vessel offers to blood flow). Researchers can
				then connect these modules, much like an electrical circuit,
				to build a complete, functional model of how blood
				circulates throughout the body.
			</p>

			<p>
				This flexibility is powerful. Scientists can easily swap
				modules or change their characteristics to simulate
				different scenarios – for example, to study the impact of a
				leaky heart valve, the stiffening of arteries, or the effect
				of a potential new treatment. By running these simulations,
				they can gain insights into how the cardiovascular system
				works in health and disease, predict changes, and explore
				"what-if" questions without needing invasive procedures.
				This makes ModularCirc a valuable tool for those working
				towards creating "digital twins" of the heart – virtual
				replicas that can help us better understand, predict, and
				manage cardiovascular health.
			</p>

			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>
				ModularCirc is available as a Python package and can be
				installed via pip:
			</p>
			<pre><code>python -m pip install ModularCirc</code></pre>
