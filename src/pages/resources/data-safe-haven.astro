				Project researchers need access to highly sensitive data from
				real-world patients to develop cardiovascular digital twins. For
				researchers to do their work securely, the Alan Turing Institute
				is hosting these datasets in its own Secure Research Environment
				(SRE): A computational environment with technical and process
				controls for safe data access. The technical controls are
				provided by the <a
					href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/data-safe-haven"
					>Turing Data Safe Haven</a
				>, an open-source project for the deployment of SREs in the
				Microsoft Azure cloud. The process controls are managed by the
				Trusted Research team, a team within the Turing's <a
					href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/research/research-engineering-group"
					>Research Engineering Group</a
				> in charge of secure data management.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
				For the CVD-Net project, we are using two SRE instances:
				<ol>
					<li>
						The Staging SRE: This SRE receives the raw patient data
						from our project partners. It is in this environment
						that the <a
							href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/data-for-research"
							>Data Wrangling team</a
						> consolidates and anonymises the data so it can be safely
						shared with the project researchers. Given its access to
						real patient data, digital twin evaluation is also performed
						in this environment.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Insights SRE: This SRE receives the processed
						datasets developed by the Data Wrangling team, so
						project researchers can develop digital twin models
						without any risk of compromising patient privacy.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
				As part of the project, we will contribute to the Turing Data
				Safe Haven codebase by building features to make it more
				cost-efficient and by making it easier to take data, code and
				other resources from one SRE and use in the other.
