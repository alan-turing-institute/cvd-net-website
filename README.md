# Networks of Cardiovascular Digital Twins (CVD-Net)

This repository contains the source code for the CVD-Net project website. 

The website is built on top of the Astro template [DataNova](https://github.com/mearashadowfax/DataNova).

> [!NOTE]
> **About CVD-Net
> CVD-Net aims to pioneering personalised cardiovascular care through interconnected digital twins.
> 
> The project aims to:
> - Develop networked digital twins for cardiovascular health, focusing initially on Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH).
> - Improve disease monitoring and prediction using these twins.
> - Enable personalised care pathways.
> - Advance the engineering science behind connected digital twins.
